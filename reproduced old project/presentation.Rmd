```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```

## Main purpose

- Reproduce old project
- Check consistency of findings on a new dataset




## Reproduce old project

- new software (R vs. Stata)
- lack of documentation about data preparation -> we tried to rely on report but information attached was too vague
- not able to reproduce the exact results



## Data preparation

- originaly performed in Excel
- this time we focused on obtaining the same data rather than on reasonable decisions



## Preparation based on report description...

...did not result in the same outcome

Old:
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height= "80px", out.width="180px"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/statistics_table.jpg")  
```

New:
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height= "80px", out.width="180px"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/statistics_table_new1.jpg")  

```


## Trimming values to the range from old project



Old:
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height= "80px", out.width="180px"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/statistics_table.jpg")  
```

New:
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.height= "80px", out.width="180px"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/statistics_table_new2.jpg")  

```
